CMPG 323 Overview

## constuct Project goals

### setup Lables


### Setup Mile stones

## create Repositories
The Following Repositories will be required for the 5 Phases of building our IoT device capturing system

**- CMPG 323 Overview**

**- CMPG 323 Project 2** API to handle sending and receiving of data from IoT devices to the database

**- CMPG 323 Project 3** Construction of an ASP.Net Core MVC Web Application which will make use of the API to send data to and   from database

**- CMPG 323 Project 4** UAT testing is an important part of finalizing hour project. We will be constructing an Automation system that can perform Repetitive UAT testing tasks, to speed up the incisal UAT process
  
**- CMPG 323 Project 5** No Application is ever complete until reporting is done- project 5 we will be constructing some reports to deliver data as Business information whereby the end users and owners of the system can make well informed decision.

## Structure of Project 
![What is this](ProjectDiagrams.png)

**Project 1 Overview** - outlining the 5 projects and there milestones. it will also consist of all the planning documents and structure layouts.

**Project 2 Constructing an API** - to handle data transfer from database to the IoT Devices. it will interface with the database and the web application or the front end of our application.

**Project 3 constructing the front end** - It will be the entry point for Users and IoT devices. Furthermore, it will interface with the database by sending to and receiving data from the API.

**Project 4 is UAT testing** - normally this would be done by a user performing repetitive task to find bugs/ errors within the application. also test the interface if it is user friendly.

**Project 5** - maybe the most important step for me is reporting. an application is only as good as the Business information that can be gained. the report will be generated directly from the database will not be interfacing through the API.
